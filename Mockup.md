# Mockups and UI Inspirations for TUI Application

This document catalogs image references and UI elements inspired by other prominent modern Text User Interface (TUI) applications. Each entry includes a brief description of the application's UI, a link to a screenshot or mockup, and notes on which UI elements we plan to derive or adapt for our own project.
